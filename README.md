# HockeyRef
 

This is a personal project that I created to test development using React. This project currently displays
two pages (a homepage and a team view page). 

- The Homepage tentatively displays a short message about the project

- The team view page displays team names and logos (sorted alphabeticaly by location name) on a grid. To view basic 
	information on team, just click on the logo to view a dropdown with information (Arena, Finals Wins, Captains,
	Coaches, etc)
